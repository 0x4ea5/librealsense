**Intel® RealSense™ Cross Platform SDK** is a cross-platform library (Linux, Windows, Mac) for working with Intel® RealSense™ depth cameras (SR300 and RS4xx series).
Developer kits containing the necessary hardware to use this library are available for purchase at [this link](http://click.intel.com/realsense.html). 


## Overview

This project contains both an API and tools for controlling Intel RealSense depth cameras and 
Additional language bindings
  * [Java (generated by JavaCPP)](https://github.com/poqudrof/javacpp-presets/tree/realsense-pull) (experimental, community maintained)
  * [Python](./bindings/python) 

The library has been integrated with a number of third-party components and operating systems. 
While most of these projects are not directly supported by the team, they are useful resources for users of this library.
  * [Robotic Operating System](https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense) (Intel Supported; R200, F200, SR300 all supported)
  * [Yocto / WindRiver Linux](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/meta-intel-librealsense)
  * [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/librealsense/)


## Quick Start

#### Step 1: Download and Install
After installing the Intel RealSense SDK (on [Linux]() \ [Windows]() \ [Os X]()), and connecting an [Intel® RealSense™ depth camera](), you are ready to start writing your first application!

> In case of any issue during initial setup, or later, please first see our [FAQ & Troubleshooting]() section. 
> If you can't find an answer there, try searching our [Closed GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed) page,  [Community](https://communities.intel.com/community/tech/realsense) and [Support](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/emerging-technologies/intel-realsense-technology.html) sites.
> If non of the above helped, [open a new issue](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/new).

#### Step 2: Ready to hack!

Our library offers a high level API for using Intel RealSense depth cameras (in addition to lower level ones).
The following snippet shows how to start streaming frames and extracting the depth value of a pixel:

```cpp
// Create a pipeline
rs2::pipeline p = ctx.create_pipeline();
// Configure and start the pipeline
p.start();
while (true)
{
    //Get a depth frame
    rs2::frameset frames = p.wait_for_frames(); //Block program until frames arrive
    rs2::depth_frame depth = frames.get_depth_frame(); //Try to get a frame with depth image
    if (!depth) continue;

    // Query distance to the target:
    rs2::point2d center_depth { depth.get_width(), depth.get_height() };
    float dist_to_center = depth.get_distance(center_depth);
    
    std::cout << "You are pointing at an object " 
		      << dist_to_center << " meters away from the camera\r";

	//Stop if object gets too far
    if (dist_to_center > 2) break;
}
```
For more information on the library, please follow our [examples](./examples), and read the [eocumentation](./doc) to learn more.
