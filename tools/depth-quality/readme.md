# Depth Quality Tool

<p align="center"><img src="res/depth_quality_glimpse.gif" /></p>

## Overview

This application allows you to test the cameraâ€™s depth quality, including: average distance to plane accuracy, standard deviation from plane, Z (distance) accuracy and fill rate.
You should be able to easily get and interpret several of the depth quality metrics and record and save the data for offline analysis.

## Quick Start
* Position the depth camera within a range of 0.5 -3 meter from a flat non-reflective surface.
* Aim the camera to the target and hold it steady for several seconds till the tool is able to recognize the surface (the yellow grid in 3D view).
* Adjust the camera using the "Angle" metric to minimize the skew and make it as  perpendicular to the surface as possible.
* Inspect the calculated depth quality metrics, expand the metric properties to get more in-depth info.

## Features
* 2D/3D Depth View
* Plane Fitting - using reconstructed surface
* User-defined Region of Interest
* Depth Quality metrics:
  * Depth average error
  * Standard Deviation
  * Fill-Rate
  * Subpixel RMS
  * Distance to target
* Export metrics and device configuration
* Depth Sensor controls
