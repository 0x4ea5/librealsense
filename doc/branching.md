* [**legacy**](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/legacy) - long-term stable releases without any new functionality.
* [**development**](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development) - new features are being prototyped here.

# Releases
As we are moving forward and API changes become less frequent, we try to follow better, more predictable versioning structure. However, up to this point the project did not strictly followed [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
